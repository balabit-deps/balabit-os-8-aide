.TH AIDE.WRAPPER 8 "Jun 20, 2018"
.SH NAME
aide.wrapper \- call aide binary for Debian mechanisms
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B aide.wrapper
.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B aide.wrapper
calls the
.B aide
binary with
.B --config
appropriate for the mechanisms automatically used in the Debian
package. To prevent damage to the database,
.B aide.wrapper
takes out a lock and will refuse to run a second aide process when
there is still another one running.

If no
.B --config
option explicitly given,
.B aide.wrapper
will set
.B --config
to
.B /var/lib/aide/aide.conf.autogenerated,
invoke
.B update-aide.conf,
and use
.B aide --config-check
to verify correctness of the configuration prior to invoking the aide binary.
.PP
.SH OPTIONS
.B aide.wrapper
hands down all options down to the aide binary verbatim and only
detects the presence of
.B --config
to determine whether to call
.B update-aide.conf
or not.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Normally, the exit status is 0 if no errors occurred. An exit status below 100 is the exit status from the actual aide binary, as documented in its own man page. The wrapper's own exit codes are defined as:
.IP "250 problem finding the aide binary"
.IP "251 cannot obtain lock file"
.IP "255 there was an error running aide --config-check"

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The environment variable DBAGE can be used to control the aide run respective to the age of
the aide databases in /var/lib/aide/aide.db(.new). This is useful when the local admin manually
recreates the database, preventing an automated aide run (for example from cron) from clobbering
the database the local admin might be inspecting at the moment. If DBAGE is set to a non-zero
value (for example from the crontab), and one of the databases is younger than DBAGE seconds, the
wrapper will print a warning, terminate without running aide and return an exit status of 0. The
default value of DBAGE is 0.
